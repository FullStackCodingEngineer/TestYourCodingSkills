## Test Your Coding Skills

## This application allows the user to test their knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by taking a quick, fun and easy quiz.

## The quiz consists of 5 questions with 4 multiple choice options to choose from. Correct answers will result in more time and and more points. Wrong answers result is negative points and a loss of time.

## After the user finishes the quiz, their result will be scored and stored in local storage. 

## To install this file, clone the code to your PC by using the "Git Clone" command in the terminal followed by the HTTP URL or simply download the zip file and unzip the contents of the file.
